Overview
Oftentimes, processes can be represented as a series of stages. The concept of an assembly line can be a useful way to organize production logic, lists of tasks in varying degrees of completion, or track individuals progressing through a series of milestones.

Here's a simple diagram of the major stages that could be in a software assembly line:

For this challenge, you'll write an Angular component that is an initial prototype of an organizational tool for personal and business use based on the assembly line concept.

After you finish coding, you'll complete a written response (details are provided at the bottom of the instructions).
